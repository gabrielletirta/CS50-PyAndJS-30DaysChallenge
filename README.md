üöÄ 30-Day CS50 Web Programming Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm embarking on a thrilling 30-day challenge! Starting on September 5th, 2023, I'm dedicating 2-3 hours every day after fulfilling all my life responsibilities to master web programming with Python and JavaScript through the CS50 Web Programming course.

Here, you'll find my journey documented in code, notes, and updates. I'm committed to diligently coding, absorbing lectures, and tracking my progress as I race against time to conquer this course by October 5th, 2023.

Join me on this exhilarating adventure as I push my boundaries and strive to become a proficient web developer. Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated! Let's learn and grow together. üíªüìöüåê #CS50WebChallenge

#05/09/2023 Day01: Finished watching **Lecture 0: HTML & CSS**. Started to do the Project 0, no confusion on this day but did not finish the project in one day as it was already too late.

#06/09/2023 Day02: Continue to do Project01, create a new file(images.html) but got stuck at positioning the 'image' text. I learned how to use SASS as well and tried to implement this to my code (+spent almost 20m for SASS tutorial on YouTube). I did not finish this project as I got stuck (and overwhelmed by the 'Advanced Search' page too (again, already too late my brain kinda lag lol) so I end my day by listening to Lecture 1: GIT.

#07/09/2023 Day03: I had a JavaScript online class (CLAG) and busy all day long, so I just watch the first 5mins of** Lecture 01: Git **video! haha

#08/09/2023 Day04: I finished video **Lecture 01: Git.** Thanks to this video I learned on Git& Github features including deploy website easily through GitHub !(wow)

#09/09/2023 Day05: Watched **Lecture 02:Python** until minute 56:52 (1:07:41 in total). From this video I learned in Sequences, Data structures(list, tuple, set, dictionaries, functions and loops), OOP, and Decorators. I aimed to finish this video by 1 hour but oh my! it was a hard pill to swallow for my newbie brain. There's so many new terms I learned about Python but I also noticed how each programming language has similar basic foundations (for me:JS). 

#10/09/2023 Day06: Spent my weekend to finish my school's work but still managed to spent couple hours finish **Lecture 02:Python** and made little update regarding Project01. Today I learned about how Decorators, Lambda Function, and Exception works. Added responsive code for Project 01 logo. üêç

#11/09/2023 Day07: Figured out how to make the 'image' sign in google images scroll. Didn't do much on this day since I got busy all day long and spent my evening for school assignments.

#12/09/2023 Day08: Watched CLAG video for this week's class and spared an hour to add responsive for whole page (google logo, search bar, 'images' sign, except for nav bar. Still figuring out how to make it stay in place while changing the website layout(responsive). 

#13/09/2023 Day09:Finished CLAG JS video for this week's class and continue to do Project01. I sort all of the index.html and images.html responsive webpage problem and start to do the advanced search page. I also learned on GitHub's rebase and merge, push pull basically everything. Sorted out the problem by myeself without asking anyone for help (HAHAHA) #happy #proud

#14/09/2023 Day10: Update advanced search page 

#15/09/2023 Day11: Added the I'm feeling lucky button. Also made several changes, and pretty much all done with Project01. (to do list: parameter, and advanced search code)

#16/09/2023 Day12: I didn't touch the code for today as I was going out the whole day (but I watched CLAG video regarding Web API)

#17/09/2023 Day13: I fixed I'm feeling lucky button, advanced search and google images code. Also, went to the State Library and did a deep research to get better understanding about GET Parameters, name (key-value). Now I can confidently say that I understand the difference between name and ID, URL Parameters (or known as Query Strings). OOT: Really enjoy studying at the library as it makes me focus so much!
