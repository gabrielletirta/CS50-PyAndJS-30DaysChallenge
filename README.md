🚀 30-Day CS50 Web Programming Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm embarking on a thrilling 30-day challenge! Starting on September 5th, 2023, I've committed to mastering the art of web programming with Python and JavaScript by completing the CS50 Web Programming course.

Here, you'll find my journey documented in code, notes, and updates. I'll be diligently coding, absorbing lectures, and tracking my progress as I race against time to conquer this course by October 5th, 2023.

Join me on this exhilarating adventure as I push my boundaries and strive to become a proficient web developer. Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated! Let's learn and grow together. 💻📚🌐 #CS50WebChallenge

05/09/2023 Day01: Finished watching Lecture 0: HTML & CSS. Started to do the Project 0, no confusion on this day but did not finish the project in one day as it was already too late.
06/09/2023 Day20: Continue to do Project01, create a new file(images.html) but got stuck at positioning the 'image' text. I learned how to use SASS as well and tried to implement this to my code. I did not finish this project as I got stuck (and overwhelmed by the 'Advanced Search' page too (again, already too late my brain kinda lag lol) so I end my day by listening to Lecture 1: GIT.
